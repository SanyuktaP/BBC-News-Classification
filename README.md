# BBC-News-Classification
Weâ€™ll use a public dataset from the BBC comprised of 2225 articles, each labeled under one of 5 categories: business, entertainment, politics, sport or tech.  The dataset is broken into 1490 records for training and 735 for testing. The goal will be to build a system that can accurately classify previously unseen news articles into the right category.
